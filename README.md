				<li>HTML</li>
				<li>CSS</li>
				<li>BOOTSTRAP</li>
				<li>JAVASCRIPT</li>
			</ul>
			</div>
			<em>I am planning to add as many features as I can, so I am always improving it. Following are part of my future implementations:</em>
			<div>
			<ul>
				<li>JAVASCRIPT</li>
				<li>METEOR</li>
				<li>MONGO DB</li>

			  <li>Improving the documentation</li>
			  <li>Probably adding some automated build mechanism while making code changes</li>
